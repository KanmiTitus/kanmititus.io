								<h3> DATA & BI ANALYST </h3>
								<p>Hello! I'm Olasunkanmi, and I'm excited to have you read about me, my fascination with data began in my undergraduate years when I became curious about how my mom’s business was performing. She didn’t keep records, and all expenses were covered directly from the business earnings. By tracking the cost of goods, calculating total revenue after sales, and determining her actual profit, I helped structure the business better. This not only gave us insight into how much we could live on but also allowed us to reinvest a portion of the profit to expand the business.</p>
								<p>As a seasoned Data and Business Intelligence Analyst with four years of experience in the iGaming, Financial institution, and SaaS domains, my passion for data analysis and visualization has allowed me to contribute meaningfully through building data and BI solutions and providing insights that drive revenue growth, performance, user acquisition, campaign success, user experience optimization, operation efficiency and identification of new opportunities for SaaS, iGaming, sports betting, and casino games offerings. My dedication to making data accessible and actionable has been fueled by a fascination with how information can shape business strategies and informed decision-making.</p>
                                <p>My expertise spans industry-leading tools such as Excel (Power Query, Power Pivot), Power BI (data modeling, DAX, dashboard, and report building, managing data security and providing access), SQL (writing optimized queries, managing databases), and Azure Cloud Warehousing (Azure data factory, Azure SQL databases). Furthermore, I am keen on continuous learning and passionate about taking on new challenges independently or collaboratively.</p>
						        <p>My experience collaborating with cross-functional teams and enhancing communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders has proven valuable in building data solutions and achieving common goals. <br />
								   With my attention to detail, presenting insights in reports, and interactive dashboards with compelling visuals, and drive for business success. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow and contribute in the evolving world of data analytics and in businesses or workplaces where challenges translate to career growth.</p>

								<h3> CHAT COMMERCE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/chat-commerce.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Clickatell empowers businesses to connect with customers via SMS, WhatsApp, and other channels, enabling seamless communication, engagement, and transactions. As a BI and Data Visualization Specialist, I conducted a comprehensive business performance analysis and developed a BI solution to drive actionable insights for our clients. </br>
								   Using SQL, I analyzed top-performing clients in terms of interactions, client engagement, end-user demographics, activity ranking, transaction analysis, and interaction success rates. Reports and actionable recommendations were delivered to guide stakeholders in resource allocation for marketing and commercial spending, optimizing acquisition costs, and improving client satisfaction and retention. </p>
								   I also developed an interactive dashboard to help clients track interaction success and failure rates (successful, pending, and failed transactions) while gaining deeper insights into their end users. </p>
								<p>Explore my analysis and dashboard to see my design thinking process, functional dashboard development, and creative approaches to solving business problems through clear data-driven communication. </p>

								<h3> CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/exit.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Customer Churn Analysis should be a regular analysis project with a product and service rendering company, facts show that it costs businesses more to acquire new customers than to maintain existing ones, and knowing this, a replica real-world problem sparked my interest in analyzing the dataset provided by Maven Analytics Telecomm Customer Churn. </p>

								<p>	I use SQL to analyze customer churn in the telecommunications industry! Through data cleaning and analysis, I was able to identify key factors contributing to churn and develop recommendations for retaining high-value customers. </p>

								<p>What insights can be derived from the 2024 Customer Service Week (CSW) free bet campaign on sports activities to optimize future campaigns? </p>

								<p>I analyzed sports betting activities including YTD aggregated betting activities before the CSW free bet offer was given, betting activities during and one week after the campaign week, and compared players' betting patterns with real money and free bets, GGR trends, and first-time deposit trends related to new users and activation of inactive players. </p>
